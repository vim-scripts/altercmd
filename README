*altercmd* is a Vim plugin to provide an easy way to alternate built-in Ex
commands by user-defined Ex commands.  This plugin provides |:AlterCommand|
for this purpose.  For example, if you define :CD, a custom version of |:cd|,
add the following in your vimrc.

	AlterCommand cd  CD

With the above setting, you can use :cd as if it is :CD.  It means that :CD
will be automatically inserted if you type :cd as an Ex command, so you don't
have to type :CD to use :cd and you'll never encounter mistyping :cd and :CD.

:AlterCommand also supports partial command names.  For example, |:help| can
be invoked with :h, :he, :hel or :help.

	AlterCommand h[elp]  HELP

With the above setting, you can use :h, :he, :hel and :help as if they are
:HELP, your own version of :help.
